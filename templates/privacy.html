                    ClawVault is designed to prioritize the security and privacy of your data. We do not collect any
                    analytical information or utilize third-party services. The information collected is solely what you

                    specified expiration date.

                    Whenever you use ClawVault, the app may collect Log Data, including device Internet Protocol (“IP”)
                    address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, time and date of usage, and other
                    statistics. This data is collected for error tracking and app improvement.

                    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                    commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                    to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                    stored on your device's internal memory.

                <p>
                    ClawVault does not use cookies explicitly. However, third-party code and libraries used by the app
                    may employ cookies to enhance services. Users have the option to accept or refuse these cookies,
                    though refusal may limit access to certain features.

                <p>
                    While ClawVault strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect personal information, it
                    cannot guarantee absolute security. Users are advised to be mindful of the limitations inherent in
                    internet transmission and electronic storage.

                    It's crucial to highlight that the decryption key required to access your data is not stored in our
                    database; it is provided to you. In the event the key is lost, the data becomes unrecoverable and is
                    automatically deleted upon reaching the specified expiration date. Importantly, we do not have the
                    capability to decrypt or access your data, ensuring your information remains confidential throughout
                    its storage period.

                    ClawVault may contain links to external sites. Users are strongly advised to review the Privacy
                    Policies of these sites, as they are not operated by Shashank Verma, and ClawVault has no control
                    over their content, privacy policies, or practices.
