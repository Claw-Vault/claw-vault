            <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>
                ClawVault is designed to prioritize the security and privacy of your data. We do not
                collect any analytical information or utilize third-party services. The information
                collected is solely what you choose to provide to the platform. This data is
                securely stored in an encrypted form until the specified expiration date.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Your trust is our priority, and we are committed to maintaining the highest

            <br />
            <p>
                Whenever you use ClawVault, the app may collect Log Data, including device Internet
                Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration,
                time and date of usage, and other statistics. This data is collected for error
                tracking and app improvement.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous
                unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit
                and are stored on your device's internal memory.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                ClawVault does not use cookies explicitly. However, third-party code and libraries
                used by the app may employ cookies to enhance services. Users have the option to
                accept or refuse these cookies, though refusal may limit access to certain features.

            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <br />
            <p>
                While ClawVault strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect personal
                information, it cannot guarantee absolute security. Users are advised to be mindful
                of the limitations inherent in internet transmission and electronic storage.

            <br />
            <p>
                It's crucial to highlight that the decryption key required to access your data is
                not stored in our database; it is provided to you. In the event the key is lost, the
                data becomes unrecoverable and is automatically deleted upon reaching the specified
                expiration date. Importantly, we do not have the capability to decrypt or access
                your data, ensuring your information remains confidential throughout its storage
                period.

                the Privacy Policies of these sites, as they are not operated by Shashank Verma, and
